\section{Types of Perceptrons}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Single-Layer Perceptron:} This type of perceptron is limited to learning linearly separable patterns. effective for tasks where the data can be divided into distinct categories through a straight line.
        \item \textbf{Multilayer Perceptron:} Multilayer perceptrons possess enhanced processing capabilities as they consist of two or more layers, adept at handling more complex patterns and relationships within the data.

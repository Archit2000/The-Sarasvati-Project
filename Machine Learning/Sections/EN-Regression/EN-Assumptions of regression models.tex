\section{Assumptions of regression models}
    In order to properly interpret the output of a regression model, the following main assumptions about the underlying data process of what you analyzing must hold:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The relationship between variables is linear
        \item Homoskedasticity, or that the variance of the variables and error term must remain constant
        \item All explanatory variables are independent of one another
        \item All variables are normally-distributed. Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
    \end{itemize}

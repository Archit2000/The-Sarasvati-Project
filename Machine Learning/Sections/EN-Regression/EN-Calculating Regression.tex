\section{Calculating Regression}
    Linear regression models often use a least-squares approach to determine the line of best fit. The least-squares technique is determined by minimizing the sum of squares created by a mathematical function. A square is, in turn, determined by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the data set.
    Once this process has been completed (usually done today with software), a regression model is constructed. The general form of each type of regression model is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple linear regression: $Y = a + bX + u$
        \item Multiple linear regression: $Y = a + b_1X_1 + ..... + b_nX_n + u$
        \item where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Y=The dependent variable you are trying to predict or explain
            \item X=The explanatory independent variables you are using to predict or associate with Y
            \item a=The y-intercept
            \item b=beta coefficient is the slope of the explanatory variables
            \item u=The regression residual or error term 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

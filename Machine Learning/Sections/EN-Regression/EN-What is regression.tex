\section{what is regression?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables.
        \item A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
        \item It does this by essentially fitting a best-fit line and seeing how the data is dispersed around this line.
        \item Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those correlations are statistically significant or not.    
    \end{enumerate}
    There are 2 types of Regression:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Simple linear regression: Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y.
        \item Multiple linear regression: Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome (while holding all others constant).
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Activation Functions}
An activation function is a crucial element in a neural network, introducing non-linearity and transforming the weighted sum of inputs into an output signal. This non-linearity allows the network to learn complex relationships and representations in the data. Here's a breakdown of different types of activation functions, their advantages and disadvantages, and suitable applications:

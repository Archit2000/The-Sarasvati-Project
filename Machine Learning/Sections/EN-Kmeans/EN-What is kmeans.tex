\section{What is K-means Clustering?}
Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machineâ€™s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. 

\section{What is the objective of k-means clustering?}
The goal of clustering is to divide the population or set of data points into a number of groups so that the data points within each group are more comparable to one another and different from the data points within the other groups. It is essentially a grouping of things based on how similar and different they are to one another.
